# Facial Expression Detection of Handicapped Person For Controlling and Communication of Virtual Keyboard
Our project is based on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Image Processing Techniques. In this project we are targeting the hands-free person and handicapped person (which only can change thier facial expressions) to interact with the computer technology. In this User's face is capture through camera, our software make bounding box around user face, detect landmarks and show landmarks on face after training. Using landmark information, it recognize the expressions, perform action on keyboard against each expression
and display it on User's Computer screen. For Example: left eye close blinking start on keyboard alphabets, person open mouth to type alphabet on screen, to move backward close right eye, move head (up, down, left, right) to move arrow keys, expand lips to press spacebar key, lift eyebrows to press backspace and both eye close to press enter key. Through this hands-free user can play games or type anything on screen.   

## Getting Started

  1. First you need a local machine to run this Software.
  2. Then take clone of this repository to run a Project.
  
### Prerequisites
 You need followings things to run this:
1. Python version 3.6.7
2. PYCHARM IDE
    - pip version 21.0.1

```
## Present Modules
1. Keyboard creation 
2. Dataset creation (images remaining)

## Future Work
1. Following modules wil be added in project.
2. Dataset Creation and Make trained Model.
3. User successfully give expression.
4. System successfully detect the face and epsression of user.
5. User can give Different kind of expression to Select keyboard key.
6. System convert the user's expression into specific action which is defined against key successfully.
7. System Trainning
