# Facial Expression Detection of Handicapped Person For Controlling and Communication of Virtual Keyboard
Our project is based on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Image Processing Techniques. In this project we are targeting the hands-free person and handicapped person (which only can change thier facial expressions) to interact with the computer technology. In this User's face is capture through camera, our software make bounding box around user face, detect landmarks and show landmarks on face after training. Using landmark information, it recognize the expressions, perform action on keyboard against each expression
and display it on User's Computer screen. For Example: left eye close blinking start on keyboard alphabets, person open mouth to type alphabet on screen, to move backward close right eye, move head (up, down, left, right) to move arrow keys, expand lips to press spacebar key, lift eyebrows to press backspace and both eye close to press enter key. Through this hands-free user can play games or type anything on screen.
